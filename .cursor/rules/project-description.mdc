## Objective
This project is used by AI enthusiasts to find partners for side projects.

## Who are the audience
Developers, Product Managers and Business folks who have a project in mind where they are looking for partners or vice versa.

## How does this work?
- The list of publicly available jobs are show to the users. They can do basic filtering by location. That's it. 
- The user can login to do a few things. 
a) Create a post for a role they are looking to get. This will be like a JD but this is a role for a peer instead of an employee. 
b) View existing open roles and apply. 
- When a user likes a role and wants to discuss, they click on "Connect". A form opens where the user can introduce themselves, their portfolio or any URL which shows their work, an intro message, attachments. Intro message is mandatory. others are optional
- Once this request is submitted, an email is sent to the creator about this request. Which will have a CTA to accept and reject. 
- If the user accepts, connect both of them over a common email. 
- If it's rejected, just log it.
