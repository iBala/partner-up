## Fixing Bugs
"Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to validate your assumptions before we move onto implementing the actual code fix"

## Implementation
Always ask for more information if something is not clear. No code changes until what you need to do is very clear. 
Use logging to identify issues comprehensively. 

## Performance should always be top of mind. 
All pages should load within 250 ms. 

## New modules
Always ask for confirmation before using new modules.
